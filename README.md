# Public-health-data-challenge
In This is Statistics’ second annual fall data challenge, high school and undergraduate students will use statistics to dig into the data and come up with their own ideas to help end this important public health crisis.   Through this contest, you will put your statistical and data visualization skills to work with a team of your high school or undergraduate peers to help create healthier communities using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Multiple Cause of Death (Detailed Mortality) data set. Although not required, teams may identify and utilize external data sets. To compete, your team must submit your materials by Monday, Nov. 12.
